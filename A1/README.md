## How to run the code

Note: We assume Jupyter Notebook is installed.
1. Download or clone ` git clone https://github.com/danseremet/comp472-assignments.git` the project.
2. Assignment 1 is located in A1 folder.
3. Open the A1.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run cells in order (so imports are correctly imported) or Run All.
5. Depending on your computer spec, it can take different amounts of time to get the
resulting csv files and run all cells. (On a performant machine it takes 20 minutes 
for all cells). (The GridSearchCV part is the slowest part)
